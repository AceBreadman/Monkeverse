This Github is a repository for a collection IP-law compliant collection of copycat social media platforms.

The project is in the design stage, and is purposed as a hobby-project and experiment.

Each copycat social media platform has a unified branding drawing inspiration from the popular 'Monke' meme.

Monke seems an appropriate branding center for a series of copycat platforms.

Some ideas associated with Monkeys are:
* Playfulness
* Copying (Monkey-see, Monkey-do)
* Rudimentary behaviour
* Simplicity
* Silliness
* Cheapness (working for peanuts)

I would expect that a collection of hobbyist knock-off social media platforms would exhibit all of the above qualities.


# Design goals

[<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23952709/152300839-287423f2-225f-45b5-9b9e-1c297bbf684d.png" width="250">](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37428009)

The design objectives of the project must take into consideration the fact that this project has a virtually empty budget; in terms of money, software development skill, computing resources, and labour resources.

Design requirements include:
* Secure, unified log-in service across all Monke platforms
* Content filtering

Design aspirations include:
* Copying of UI features
* Minimal reliance upon external packages & code to minimise maintenance requirements
* Minimization of social-media features to bare essentials, to minimise complexity
* <b>Simplified</b> utilities to enhance/enable online social interaction, similar to existing social media platforms
